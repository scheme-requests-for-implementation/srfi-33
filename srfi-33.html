  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>R5RS Scheme has no utilities for performing bitwise logical
  operations on integers or bitstrings, which is a problem for
  authors of portable code. This SRFI proposes a coherent and
  comprehensive set of these functions; it is accompanied by a
  reference implementation of the spec in terms of a set of seven
  core operators. The reference implementation is</p>
  <ul>
    <li>portable</li>
    <li>efficient</li>
    <li>completely open, public-domain source</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The precise semantics of these operators is almost never an
  issue. A consistent, portable set of <b>names</b> and
  <b>parameter conventions</b>, however, is. Hence this SRFI.</p>

  <h1>Function specifications</h1>
  <p>In a Scheme system that has a module or package system, these
  functions should be contained in a module named "bitwise-lib".
  They may additionally be provided as part of the general suite of
  numerical operations.</p>
  <p>In the following function specifications all parameters are
  exact integers; unless otherwise indicated, all return values are
  exact integers. It is an error to pass values of other types as
  arguments to these functions.</p>
  <p>Bitstrings are represented by integers, using a
  two's-complement encoding of the bitstring. Thus every integer
  represents a semi-infinite bitstring, having either a finite
  number of zeroes (negative integers) or a finite number of ones
  (non-negative integers). The bits of a bitstring are numbered
  from the rightmost/least-significant bit: bit #0 is the rightmost
  or 2^0 bit, bit #1 is the next or 2^1 bit, and so forth.</p>

    <li>
      <p>These 16 procedures correspond to the complete set of
	two-argument boolean functions, that is, the complete set of bit
	x bit -&gt; bit functions. For each such function, the
	corresponding bitwise operator maps that function across a pair
	of bitstrings in a bit-wise fashion. I have chosen to provide the
	full set, barring the last, trivial group of six.</p>
      <p>The core idea of this group of functions is this bitwise
	"lifting" of the set of dyadic boolean functions to bitstring
	parameters; the variadic generalisations are made where
	sensible.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>The n-ary functions have these base, nullary cases:</p>

  (bitwise-nand) =&gt;  0     (bitwise-nor) =&gt; -1
  (bitwise-xor)  =&gt;  0     (bitwise-eqv) =&gt; -1
      </pre></li>
    <li>
      <p>Note that (bitwise-eqv a b c) does <b>not</b> produce a 1 bit
	everywhere a, b & c all agree. That is, it does <b>not</b>
	produce</p>

  (bitwise-ior (bitwise-and a b c)
  (bitwise-and (bitwise-not a)

      <p>Rather, it produces <code>(bitwise-eqv a (bitwise-eqv b

  </ul>
  <h1>Rationale</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>These operations interpret exact integers using
  two's-complement representation; integers thus represent
  semi-infinite bit-strings. They are only defined for exact
  integer arguments.</li>
  <li>It is not optional for the associative bitwise ops to be n-ary
  instead of merely binary. They are required to be n-ary.
  Programmers can <b>reliably</b> write BITWISE-AND with 3
  arguments, for example.</li>
  <li>This design mirrors the structure of Common Lisp's pretty
    closely. Here are some differences:
  <ul>
    <li>"load" and "deposit" are the wrong verbs (e.g., Common
    Lisp's LDB and DPB ops), since these guys have nothing to do
    with the store. I chose "extract" and "replace."</li>
    <li>Common Lisp's byte datatype doesn't seem to buy you
    anything over just spelling out size & position, or [start,end)
    values.</li>
    <li>I punted BOOLE; it is not one with the Way of Scheme.
    Boolean functions are directly encoded in Scheme as first-class
    functions.</li>
    <li>My name choices are more in tune with Scheme conventions
    (hyphenation, using "?" to mark a predicate, etc.). Common
    Lisp's name choices were more historically motivated, for
    reasons of backward compatibility with Maclisp and
    Zetalisp.</li>
    <li>I punted the prefix "log" in favor of "bitwise-" (e.g,
    LOGNOT, BITWISE-NOT)
      <ul>
        <li>The integer ops are no more "logical" than the #f/#t
        ops, so the "log" prefix is misleading.</li>
        <li>The integer ops are bitwise in nature; the prefix
        "bitwise-" more accurately reflects what they do.</li>
        <li>There is general agreement among people I've polled
        that this is the right prefix.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I also punted the 6 trivial binary boolean ops. I kept the
    six non-trivial but less common ops.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><b>Is the inclusive-or function written "or" or "ior"?</b>
  <p>This kind of thing trips me up all the time when I use these
  types of functions. In my design, there's a simple rule: it is
  <b>never</b> simply "or." The "or" always has modifiers -- "xor,"
  "ior," "nor," "orc1," and "orc2."</p>
  <p>As it turns out, my boolean op names are <b>exactly</b> Common
  Lisp's. Although that was not an important criterion for the
  design, it's an extra plus.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><b>Why not a minimal set of ops?</b></p>
  <p>I included extra and redundant functions such as BIT-COUNT,
  BITWISE-NOR, and the bit-field ops in my design. Doing so helps
  readability, writability, and efficiency.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Readability:</p>
      <p>Settling on a standard choice of names makes it easier to
      read code that uses these sorts of operations. It also means
      computations can be clearly expressed using the more powerful
      ops rather than synthesized with a snarled mess of
      BITWISE-AND's, -OR's, and -NOT's.</p>
      <p>Most of these derived ops are simple to implement in under
      three lines of code. Providing a basic implementation does
      not put a burden on the implementor. In fact, all but seven
      of the ops can be defined in 31 lines of code, which I append
      below.</p>
      <p>What we gain is having an agreed-upon set of names by
      which we can refer to these functions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Writability:</p>
      <p>The programmer doesn't have to re-implement these
      functions, and stumble over the boundary cases and error
      checking. The programmer can express himself using a full
      palette of building blocks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Efficiency:</p>
      <p>Compilers can directly implement these ops for great
      efficiency gains without requiring any tricky analysis.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you believe in "small is beautiful," then what is your
  motivation for including anything beyond BITWISE-NAND?</p>
  <li>
  <p><b>Why no "logical" right or left shift operations?</b></p>
  <p>Because they are not well defined on general integers; they
  are only defined on integers in some finite range. Remember that,
  in this library, integers are interpreted as <b>semi-infinite</b>
  bit strings that have only a finite number of ones or a finite
  number of zeroes. "Logical" shifting shifts bit strings of some
  fixed size. If we shift left, then leftmost bits "fall off" the
  end (and zeroes shift in on the right). If we shift right, then
  zeroes shift into the string on the left (and rightmost bits fall
  off the end). So to define a logical shift operation, <b>we must
  specify the size of the window.</b> Typically this is the width
  of the underlying machine's register set (e.g., 32 bits). This is
  blatantly machine-specific & unportable, and clearly not the
  right thing for Scheme's more machine-independent general
  integers. For Scheme's integers, arithmetic shift is the right
  thing. Note that this situation pertains as well in Common Lisp,
  and Common Lisp does exactly what this SRFI does: arithmetic
    shift, but no logical shift.</p>
  <p>If we were to define a "width 32" or "width 64" or "fixnum"
  integer datatype, then we could meaningfully define logical shift
  for these values.</p>
  <p>Alternately, we could define a "general" logical shift
  operation that took as an extra argument the size of the
  bitstring. At this point, we are bending over backward to
  force-fit an operation into Scheme that fundamentally doesn't
  belong. Arithmetic shift is the right thing for general
  integers.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><b>In June 1996, this proposal went through a round of
  discussion on the Net</b>, in particular with Will Clinger and
  Aubrey Jaffer. This resulted in several updates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The functions were explicitly required to operate only on
    exact integers.</li>
    <li>ASH was renamed ARITHMETIC-SHIFT.</li>
    <li>BIT-COUNT was preferred to POP-COUNT and POPULATION-COUNT.
    Note that, as Clinger points out, "BIT-" is the proper prefix
    for this operation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After the discussion converged, the proposal sat on my disk
  for six years.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><b>This is a purely functional, side-effect-free
  implementation of bit operations</b> -- all operations produce
  new, fresh results, rather than modifying old values. This can be
  implemented very efficiently for small bit vectors -- small
  enough to be unboxed values. Algorithms that work on larger bit
  vectors, however (such as data-flow analysis engines), might wish
  an alternate data-structure and associated set of operations that
  permits side-effecting or linear-updating operations (or both) on
  bit vectors. MIT Scheme, for example, provides such a facility.
  This should be considered for another SRFI. (See the short
  summary of the MIT Scheme system below.)</p>
  <p>I suggest that the design of such a system be deferred until
  SRFIs for strings and vectors have been finalised. Than a
  bit-vector SRFI could be designed that would preserve common
  structure with these other SRFIs, as well as the bitwise library
  in this SRFI.</p>
  <p>Note also that finite bit vectors have an isomorphism to
  finite sets. The design of both set-package and bit-vector SRFIs
  would probably want to keep this in mind -- maintaining parallel
    functional structure in the design.</p></li></ul>

  <p>MIT Scheme also has a distinct datatype, the "bit vector." A
  bit vector is <b>very</b> different, in that it its elements are
  mutable -- it is a mutable vector of bits.</p>
  <p>Constants are written with a sharp-star prefix, e.g.
  <code>#*11111</code>.</p>

  <h2>Reference implementation</h2>
  <p>There are 24 functions in the spec. 15 can be defined in under
  two lines of code; REPLACE-BIT-FIELD needs three lines; and
  BITWISE-EQV needs five. This is not an onerous implementation
  load; I provide the code below. As this is only 31 lines of code,
  it hardly seems reasonable to bother discussing copyright. To lay
  the issue to rest, I am the sole author, and I place it in the
  public domain.</p>
  <p>That leaves 7 basic functions that must be primitively defined
  for each implementation: BITWISE-{NOT,AND,IOR,XOR},
  ARITHMETIC-SHIFT, BIT-COUNT, and INTEGER-LENGTH. Slib has
  implementations of even these functions using R4RS arithmetic, so
  a simple-minded implementation again doesn't need to do much to
  support them -- however, slib's general implementations are
  terribly inefficient relative to native support and should
  <b>not</b> be used except in case of dire emergency. (It's quite
  clever code, nonetheless, to provide the semantics with such
  little support.)</p>
  <p>A good implementation might choose to provide direct
  compiler/interpreter support for these derived functions, or
  might simply define them to be integrable -- i.e.,
  inline-expanded.</p>
  <p>The n-ary BITWISE-EQV function should also receive primitive
  compiler/interpreter support so that the expensive n-ary
  mechanism is not invoked in the standard cases -- that is, an
  application of BITWISE-EQV should be rewritten into an equivalent
  tree applying some two-argument primitive to the arguments, in
  the same manner that statically-known n-ary applications of
  associative operations such as <code>+</code> and <code>*</code>
  are handled efficiently:</p>
  <pre>
  (bitwise-eqv)         =&gt; -1
  (bitwise-eqv i)       =&gt; i
  (bitwise-eqv i j)     =&gt; (%bitwise-eqv i j)
  (bitwise-eqv i j k)   =&gt; (%bitwise-eqv (%bitwise-eqv i j) k)
  (bitwise-eqv i j k l) =&gt; (%bitwise-eqv (%bitwise-eqv (%bitwise-eqv i j) k) l)

  ;;; Helper function -- make a mask of SIZE 1-bits, e.g. (%MASK 3) = #b111.
  ;;; Suppose your Scheme's fixnums are N bits wide (counting the sign bit,

  ;;; handle SIZE in the range [0,N-1] without overflowing to bignums.
  ;;; (For SIZE &gt;= N, the correct bignum value is also produced.)

  (define (%mask size) (bitwise-not (arithmetic-shift -1 size)))

  ;;;     (- (arithmetic-shift 1 size) 1)

  ;;;
  ;;; Finally, note that even Feeley's expression can't build an N-bit mask
  ;;; without bignum help. This is fundamental, since the interpretation
  ;;; of fixed-size fixnum bit patterns as semi-infinite-bit-strings is that

  <h2>Topics to be resolved during discussion phase</h2>
  <p>I particularly solicit comments about the following
  topics.</p>
  <h3>SIZE/POSITION vs. FROM/TO field specs</h3>
  <p>Several functions in this library</p>
  <pre>
  extract-bit-field size position i -&gt; integer
  test-bit-field?   size position i -&gt; boolean
  clear-bit-field   size position i -&gt; integer
  replace-bit-field size position new-field i -&gt; integer
  copy-bit-field    size position from to     -&gt; integer
    </pre>
  <p>specify a contiguous "field" of bits in a bitstring. There are
  two conventions we might use to do so:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SIZE/POSITION E.g., "the 8-bit field beginning at bit 3",
    and</li>
    <li>FROM/TO E.g., "the field from bit 3 up to, but not
    including, bit 11", or, perhaps, "the field from bit 3 up to
    bit 10, inclusive."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>FROM/TO specs are conventionally and most usefully "half-open"
  specs, meaning "all i such that FROM &lt;= i and i &lt; TO" --
  the FROM index is included and the TO index is excluded.</p>
  <p>I have chosen to use SIZE/POSITION instead of FROM/TO for this
  library. Doing so eliminates any possibility of fencepost errors
  on the TO endpoint. It is also the convention chosen by Common
  Lisp.</p>
  <p>It is not, however, a widely-used convention within Scheme.
  Most ranges in Scheme are specified with half-open intervals of
  the [from,to) form (e.g., (substring s from to)). One might argue
  that SIZE/POSITION is still the right thing for bit fields, as
  they are, in practice, frequently of fixed size, unlike element
  ranges in strings or vectors.</p>
  <h2>Order of arguments for non-bitstring parameters</h2>
  <p>The "bitwise boolean" functions such as BITWISE-AND only take
  bitstring parameters. But the following 10 functions are
  different in that they take other <b>kinds</b> of parameters
  (masks, indices, field sizes) that indicate <b>the exact
  operation to perform</b> on the bitstring parameter(s):</p>
  <pre>
  arithmetic-shift i count -&gt; integer
  bitwise-merge mask i0 i1 -&gt; integer
  bit-set? index i -&gt; boolean
  any-bits-set? test-bits i -&gt; boolean
  all-bits-set? test-bits i -&gt; boolean
  extract-bit-field size position i -&gt; integer
  test-bit-field?   size position i -&gt; boolean
  clear-bit-field   size position i -&gt; integer
  replace-bit-field size position new-field i -&gt; integer
  copy-bit-field    size position from to     -&gt; integer
    </pre>
  <p>Note that in all of these functions, with the sole exception
  of ARITHMETIC-SHIFT, the bitstring parameter comes last. This is
  consistent with an "operation currying" convention, wherein the
  arguments that determine the operation come first, and the actual
  value upon which we operate comes last. MAP and FOLD, for
  example, work this way, too. (The "op currying" convention is
  actually useful in SML; in Scheme, its utility is almost entirely
  as a mnemonic convention to aid programmers in remembering
  argument order.)</p>
  <p>ARITHMETIC-SHIFT is entrenched by long and consistent
  tradition in the indicated parameter order; it would be a mistake
  to alter this. Every implementation of Scheme I have checked that
  offers a bit-shift operation on integers (PLT Scheme, slib,
  Bigloo, Scheme 48, and MIT Scheme), as well as Common Lisp, uses
  the "i count" argument order.</p>
  <p>As an alternative to the "op currying" order, we could use the
  "data-structure accessor" convention, wherein the data-structure
  being accessed (the bitstring) comes first, and the "selector"
  arguments come after. For example, this is the convention used
  for the functions VECTOR-REF and STRING-REF. One could make the
  argument that this convention could be reasonably applied to some
  of these operators, such as BIT-SET?</p>
  <p>I recommend leaving things as they are, for maximal
  consistency with a simple rule. This also provides consistency
  with Common Lisp, whose bitwise functions uniformly use the
  ops-curry convention (see the "related designs" summary
  below).</p>
  <h2>The name "bit-set?"</h2>
  <p>BIT-SET? uses the term "bit set," but that sounds like "Is
  this a set of bits?" as well as the intended "is the bit set?" On
  the other hand, a set of bits is a not-very-useful notion (there
  are, after all, only four such sets), so I haven't pre-empted
  anything we'd ever really want for some other purpose, such as a
  term like "bit vector" or something...</p>
